# HosTeller


This project was created with the objective of helping manage various activities in a hostel. 

The user will be provided with two login options: Admin and Student. 
The admin login will be provided access to insert, search and delete records. 
The student login enables the user to search for records and view hostel rules and regulations and 
other basic hostel facilities such as types of rooms available and their rent.

B Tree data structure was used for insertion, search and deletion. 
B Tree is a special type of self-balancing search tree in which each node can contain more than one key and can have more than two children. 
It allows insert, search and update in a faster and memory efficient way. 
If we have to store a large number of keys, then the height of such trees becomes very large and the access time increases. 
B Tree helps decreases the height significantly allowing faster disk access.
